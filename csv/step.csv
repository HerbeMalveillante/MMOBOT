9;You meet another explorer walking in the opposite direction. Their clothes are in tatters and their body is covered with burns. You can't help but internally judge them for not having taken the renowned dragon fighting courses at Explorer's University.;None;None
10;As you walk, a huge herd of deer crosses the path in front of you. You hasten to pull out your sketchbook to capture the moment, but by the time you're ready, they're all gone. You sure do wonder why no one has thought about creating some magic artifice to instantly capture an image.;None;None

18;You start thinking about how small you are compared to the infinity of the universe and time. Your actions have no consequences on the world, your money is just words on a paper, your toughts are ephemeral electrical connections between neurons, you only are a buch of actoms moving together. Maybe you don't even really exist, and you're just a simulation running on some superior entity's computer ? Eveything seems different now.

22;You come across a small goblin running with a bag full of gold coins in his arms. As you are a cruel person, you take advantage of his small size to steal the bag from him stashing away the gold in your pockets.

As you finish collecting the coins that dropped, a man dressed in royal clothing comes by, asking everyone around if they've seen a "green sh*t" nearby. You surely didn't.;Gold;None

25;You enter a huge cavern populated with hundreds of bluish bugs wandering around. Strange rocks, maybe skulls or shells, are encrusted on the walls. They seem to be as old as the Earth itself.
